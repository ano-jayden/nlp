 In support of this assertion, a great example of NLP is Google’s Duplex, the AI that can call people and make conversations as native as possible to persuade them on behalf of the user. Masked off, the below-improved documentation primarily scans the U.S. with the goal of facilitating everyday chores, phone reminders, or a phone call to check if a place is open. Strengthened with the achievement in natural language processing, ASR and TTS technology, this system produces a delightful ease of hominid conversation if not changed.

What Google Duplex Achieves

The purpose of this system is to remove annoying milestones from the user’s way. Most of these are time-consuming or tiresome processes, or require face-to-face meetings with people. Making or receiving calls is one of the simplest yet challenging tasks for a computer system. Making phone calls involves communication that is often quite dynamic and unpredictable thanks to human language, accents, noise, interruptions and informal language. Duplex, thanks to its cognitive capabilities, can even perform such activities, impersonating people, communicating with them in the dialect and understanding not only the words but also all the accompanying emotions and intonations. This will help in interactions and ease the amount of time and resources dedicated to service orientation by companies.

How Google Duplex Works

The operation of duplex systems is based on advanced NLP models and artificial intelligence models coupled with machine learning.

Cortana by Microsoft is a good example of an advanced application of NLP technology. This device is a virtual personal assistant intended to optimize task completion by the user. Cortana is able using voice commands to answer questions, organize meetings, remind users of calendar events and operating smart devices. With NLP support, Cortana can accept free form text from users instead of just command inputs from the interface.

Cortana is taxiing to position for takeoff, which means restructuring and orchestration of tasks. It is embedded with technology that enables a computer to accept verbal instructions. For example, recognizing Janet Smith tomorrow at two o clock saying, “Remember me two do smith Janet” raises a reminder on Cortina with events in the calendar. Also Cortana learns the user and adapts responses according to their likes and behavior. While its place is to be within windows and other Microsoft services deployment, the impact that it has on people’s day to day activities shows a wider view on the possibilities of voice bara- i.e CAS.
